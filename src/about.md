# About Me

Hello, I'm Bryant. I'm a developer who writes about code, design, and the web.

## What I Do

I build things with modern web technologies and care deeply about:

- Clean, maintainable code
- Accessible design
- Performance optimization
- User experience

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is where I share my thoughts on software development, design patterns, and lessons learned from building things on the web. I aim to write clearly and honestly about both successes and failures.
