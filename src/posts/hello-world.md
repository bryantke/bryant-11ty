Welcome to my new blog. I've been thinking about starting this for a while, and I finally decided to just build it and start writing.

There's something valuable about having your own space on the web. A place where you can share ideas, document your learning, and connect with others who care about similar things.

I plan to write about:

- Code and software development
- Things I'm learning
- Projects I'm building

I built this site with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a simple static site generator. The design is intentionally minimalâ€”focused on readability and content without all the fancy features.

The entire site is:
- Fast (no JavaScript frameworks)
- Accessible (semantic HTML)
- Portable (static files)

Thanks for reading. More to come soon.
